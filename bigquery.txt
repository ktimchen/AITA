Google BigQuery getting the AITA comments from 2018-2019:
```
SELECT body
FROM TABLE_QUERY([fh-bigquery:reddit_comments], "table_id LIKE '2019%' OR table_id LIKE '2018%'")
WHERE subreddit = "AmItheAsshole" 
###AND score>=3
AND (LOWER(body) LIKE "nta%" OR LOWER(body) LIKE "% nta%" OR LOWER(body) LIKE "yta%" OR LOWER(body) LIKE "% yta%")
```

This takes care of the strings like ponYTAil and coNTAct.
