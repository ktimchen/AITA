Analysis of the r/AmItheAsshole comments.

The AITA subreddit is an incredible source of human emotions, moral dilemmas and judgements. Many of the comments are self-labeled by the users themselves. Here's an example:

The most common labels are NTA, YTA, ESH (everyone sucks here) and NAH (stands for no assholes here). In this project, we remove the labels from the comments and develop a model that predicts whether the commenter thinks that the OP's actions were that of an asshole, or not and OP is innocent. The AITA subreddit has about 2 million clearly defined NTA comments and 1 million YTA comments in the period of 2018-2019. Of course, there are many more comments within that time period, which do not include YTA or NTA in their text, or include both words, or have less than 3 upvotes. However, we did not consider these relevant for this project.

Along the way, we find the most important words that indicate the approval or disapproval of the OP's actions (the graph above).
