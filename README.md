Analysis of the r/AmItheAsshole comments.

The AITA subreddit is an incredible source of human emotions, moral dilemmas and judgements. Many of the comments are self-labeled by the users themselves. Here's a couple of examples:


> NTA because she agreed to go to the game but I really can’t blame her. Nothing more boring than cricket and baseball in terms of sport so I really don’t blame her for not wanting to go.

> NTA, you prioritized the needs of your daughter over your co-workers, nothing wrong with that. Nobody deserves to know about your personal life, and they should have been happy to learn about this rather than act like you are required to contribute to the office gossip mill.

> It sounds like let built up resentments get the better of you and you lashed out. Your concerns aren't invalid, but the way you addressed them seem inappropriate.YTA.

> YTA. It really was none of your business. You made a scene, tried to discipline a child that was not yours over a scenario you knew nothing about, and wasted everyone’s time. Just because you wouldn’t give your child permission to use your card doesn’t mean everyone else is the same. She used her own card in the end so her family obviously has the money. You may have meant well but you were absolutely in the wrong on this one.

The most common labels are NTA, YTA, ESH (everyone sucks here) and NAH (stands for no assholes here). In this project, we remove the labels from the comments and develop a model that predicts whether the commenter thinks that the OP's actions were that of an asshole, or not and OP is innocent.

The AITA subreddit has about 2 million clearly defined NTA comments and 1 million YTA comments in the period of 2018-2019. Of course, there are many more comments within that time period, which do not include YTA or NTA in their text, or include both words, or have less than 3 upvotes. However, we did not consider these relevant for this project.

Along the way, we find the most important words that indicate the approval or disapproval of the OP's actions (the graph above). Some of them are internet-specific, such as "shitpost" and "fake", while the others are universal for the humankind - "gulit", "toxic", "gaslighting"...
